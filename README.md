# Diffany ####

Diffany is an open-source toolbox for calculating and visualizing differential networks. It is packaged in three separate modules: the algorithms as the **core library**, a **commandline interface** to generate Diffany networks through the console, and a **cytoscape plugin** for generation, visualisation and easy manipulation of the input and output networks. 

Please consult the separate manuals for the library core, the commandline interface or the cytoscape plugin for additional details on **installation and usage**.
